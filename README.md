# Discussion-populaire
To make your interactions easier, we use a bot named Discussion populaire in voice channels. No more shouting or interrupting others to be heard—just request the floor with a non-verbal sign in the text channel associated with the voice channel. Someone will then give you the floor; but who? That’s exactly what the bot does: it randomly designates the first person when launched with the !start command. Of course, that person can pass their turn by typing !pass, and then we proceed in alphabetical order. To return to a classic discussion, simply stop the bot by typing !stop.
